# A1528B eSRD Range Profile UART Recorder

Dashboard title:

`A1528B eSRD range profile V02 2026.06.25 15:08`

## Purpose

Read JSON-per-line range records from the Radar UART port through a PC USB-UART adaptor, show a real-time curve by `fn`, and save the parsed data to CSV.

## Browser Global URL Version

Open `index.html` from an HTTPS host such as GitHub Pages to read the radar UART directly in Chrome or Edge with the Web Serial API.

| Item | Behavior |
|---|---|
| UART access | The radar USB-UART adaptor must be connected to the same PC that opens the web page. |
| Browser | Chrome or Edge. Firefox/Safari do not support Web Serial. |
| URL requirement | HTTPS or localhost. A GitHub Pages URL is valid. |
| Save data | Use `Download CSV` and `Download Raw` in the page. Browsers cannot silently write to `./data`. |
| Plot colors | `r0` red, `r1` green, `r2` blue. |

## Run

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python gep_uart_recorder.py
```

## Defaults

| Item | Default |
|---|---|
| COM port | `COM5` |
| Baud rate | `921600` |
| Plot window | `300` frames |
| CSV filename | `data/jb_GEP_dataset_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` |
| Raw log filename | `data/jb_GEP_dataset_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_raw.log` |

## Expected UART JSON Line

```json
{"fn": 123, "r0": 1.234, "r1": 1.567, "r2": 1.890}
```

Required:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `fn` | Frame number |

Optional plotted fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `r0` | Range channel 0 |
| `r1` | Range channel 1 |
| `r2` | Range channel 2 |

## Notes

- Use `Refresh` to update the COM port list.
- Baud rate is editable before pressing `Start`.
- The save filename is shown in green after recording starts.
- Click `Open ./data folder` to browse saved CSV and raw log files.
- CSV is flushed after each valid JSON record to reduce data loss.
- Bad JSON lines are counted and skipped, while raw text is still saved to the raw log.
## Native MQTT Bridge

For a normal MQTT TCP broker, use the local Windows Python bridge instead of browser MQTT/WebSocket.

Flow:

```text
Radar -> COM5 -> PC Python bridge -> derived height_cm -> native MQTT publish
```

Default publish format:

```text
topic: height_cm
payload: {"fn":123,"height_cm":182.3,"timetag":"2026.06.29 16:48:30.123"}
```

Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run with defaults:

```powershell
python uart_to_mqtt_bridge.py --port COM5 --baud 921600 --mqtt-host 59.124.7.96 --mqtt-port 1883 --topic height_cm
```

Or edit `run_uart_to_mqtt_bridge.bat` and double-click it. When this bridge owns COM5, do not also click `Connect UART` in the browser page.
## Browser Curve to Native MQTT Helper

Use this mode when the browser URL should keep reading COM5, drawing the curve, and deriving height, but native MQTT TCP must publish through Python.

Flow:

```text
Radar -> COM5 -> browser URL curve/height -> localhost helper -> native MQTT TCP 59.124.7.96:1883
```

Start the helper first:

```powershell
run_native_mqtt_helper.bat
```

Then open the URL, click `Connect UART`, and click `Start Native MQTT`. The browser posts payloads to `http://127.0.0.1:8765/publish`; the helper publishes them to topic `height_cm`.

Payload format:

```json
{"fn":123,"height_cm":182.3,"timetag":"2026.06.30 12:04:30.123"}
```
